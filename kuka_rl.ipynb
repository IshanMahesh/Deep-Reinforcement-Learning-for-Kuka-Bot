    "on the pyBullet Kuka environment based on:\n",
    "https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**\n",
    "The agent has to decide between seven (2+2+2+1) actions - moving the manipulator \n",
    "in $x$ (2), or $y$ (2) directions by vertical angle offset (2) or not moving at all (1) - so that the manipulator can grasp an object. We assume that the velocity for each directions equal and there is a \"height hack\" where the gripper automatically moves down for each action.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses\n",
    "an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also\n",
    "returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this\n",
    "task, the reward is 1 if one of the objects is above height .2 at the end \n",
    "of the episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pyBullet Kuka is designed so that the inputs to the agent are (48, 48, 3) images\n",
    "representing the environment state.\n",
    "Neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the\n",
    "scene, so we'll use stack of consecutive screens as an input. In this way, we are hoping to capture the dynamics of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's import needed packages. Firstly, we need gym\n",
    "(Install using `pip install gym`) and pyBullet (Install using `pip install pybullet`.\n",

    "\n",
